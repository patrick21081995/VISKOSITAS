# VISKOSITAS
VISKOSITAS Beta version â€” Predict viscosity of multicomponent chemical systems

VISKOSITAS Beta is a shallow neural network and has better efficiency when compared to neural networks in literature and other commercial software and uses the values of chemical composition and temperature to predict the viscosity value of the chemical system at the given temperature.
