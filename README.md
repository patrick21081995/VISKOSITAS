### Viskositas  — Predict viscosity of multicomponent chemical systems

_Viskositas_ (Beta) is a shallow neural network and has better efficiency when compared to neural networks in literature and other commercial software and uses the values of chemical composition and temperature to predict the viscosity value of the chemical system at the given temperature.

The database consists viscosity data with chemical composition and temperature of each sample and experimental test carried out, through 75 international scientific articles composing a database with 19 different chemical species. The experimental measurements were analyzed only by the rotational method. The database has a range up to log₁₀ η=8 (or log η≈18.42) (log = logₑ) in fully liquid chemical systems.

There is a wide range of temperature in industrial processes, such as in the production, refining and solidification of steel, refining, homogenization and molding of glass and geophysical systems, for example.

All references used in mathematical and computational modeling, database, data analysis and computational model construction can be seen in the work of Duchesne et al. (2013) and/or Anjos undergratuate thesis (2021). The synthetic minority oversampling technique for regression with Gaussian noise (SMOGN) (SEE References below) was used as an over-sampling technique to balance the data.

A GUI application can be downloaded in Versions > VISKOSITAS_Beta_0.4.1.exe (updates can be seen in versions_update).
