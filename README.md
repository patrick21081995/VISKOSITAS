### VISKOSITAS  — Predict viscosity of multicomponent chemical systems

VISKOSITAS Beta is a shallow neural network and has better efficiency when compared to neural networks in literature and other commercial software and uses the values of chemical composition and temperature to predict the viscosity value of the chemical system at the given temperature.

The database consists viscosity data with chemical composition and temperature of each sample and experimental test carried out, through 75 international scientific articles composing a database with 19 different chemical species. The experimental measurements were analyzed only by the rotational method. The database has a range up to log₁₀ η=8 (or log η≈18.42) (log = logₑ) in fully liquid chemical systems.

There is a wide range of temperature in industrial processes, such as in the production, refining and solidification of steel, refining, homogenization and molding of glass and geophysical systems, for example.

Data from Yang et al. (2021) were used as test data to evaluate the efficiency of VISKOSITAS Beta in relation to the Duchesne, ANNliq, FactSage® 8.0 and VISCOSITAS (full model) models. VISKOSITAS Beta demonstrated better efficiency than the Duchesne, ANNliq, FactSage® 8.0 models and the VISCOSITAS (full version) had fewer errors in the statistical methods used.
