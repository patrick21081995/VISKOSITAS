Versions Updates:

0.2.0 (October 10th, 2021) (discontinued)

- Fixed a bug in time (t (s)) related in high percentage/mass fraction in V₂O₅ (vanadium pentoxide).
- Decreasing the time execution.

0.3.0 (October 16th, 2021) (discontinued)

- Added 30 lines for calculating viscosity.
- Using Cut, Copy and Delete in the Edit menu. There is also the Paste mechanism (classic "Ctrl+C Ctrl+V") in the application.
- Button "Calculate Viscosity (log η)" in the main menu.
- Time execution (t (s) ) in the bottom of the application. Decreasing the time execution.

0.3.1 (October 28th, 2021)

- Float numbers can be used as input data (chemical composition and temperature). Viscosity (log η) with 4 decimal numbers.
- Unlocking the Open and Save options in File in the main menu.
- Added Multi-VISKOSITAS mode (only in FULL version).
- Decreasing the time execution.

0.4.0 (November 7th, 2021)

- Use of 20 lines, instead of 30 lines of the previous version, inducing greater performance and reducing execution time;
- Time execution ("Time execution (s)"), at the bottom of the application, can now be copied and pasted to check the speed of VISKOSITAS.
- Addition of 1 more example, in Steelmaking, in a slag SiO₂-CaO-MgO-Al₂O₃.
- In the Help menu, the options are introduced:
  - "Base File (.csv)", where a file can be downloaded to be used as a basis for VISKOSITAS calculations.
  The .csv file has 20 different data from Yang et al. (2021) (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmrt.2021.03.069);
  - "Errors and Exceptions", introducing errors and exceptions in the programming and GUI of VISKOSITAS.

0.4.1 (November 9th, 2021)

- Minor bug fixes.

1.0 (Soon!)

- Computer model update (deep neural network for viscosity prediction);
- Pipeline introduction;
- Positional changes addition of 30 lines in the GUI with great performance and lower execution time.
